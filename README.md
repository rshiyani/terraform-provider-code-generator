# terraform-provider-code-generator (terrajinja)

Terrajinja is a CLI tool which leads to the creation of Terraform Provider Code File. The data used by Terrajinja for creation of Terraform Provider File is provided in the form of YAML.


Technologies Used: 
Jinja - Used for Templating
Python - Used for CLI Creation

## File Structure

```

   - `--pname`(Provider Name): This flag is a required.
   - `--generate`: Here the comma seperated string is provided. By default the value of this is "all". Supported Values: `resource`, `resource_test`, `datasource`,     `datasource_test`, `provider`, `provider_test`, `model`, `client` and `client_test`
   - `--input`: Comma separated list of input files, default value is `all`.

   > ðŸ‘€Note: `.yaml` extension may not work. Prefer using `.yml`
   
### Examples:
   ```
   ./terrajinja --pname="YourProviderName"
   ```
   Above command will generate all the terraform provider files for the ymls provided in config.

   ```
   ./terrajinja --pname="YourProviderName" --input="contract,tenant"
   ```
   Above command will generate all the terraform provider files for the ymls provided in config for resource contract and tenant only.
   ```
   ./terrajinja --pname="YourProviderName" --generate="resource,resource_test"
   ```
   Above command will generate the terraform provider resource and resource_test files for the ymls provided in config.
   ```
   ./terrajinja --pname="YourProviderName" --input="tenant" --generate="datasource,datasource_test"
   ```
   Above command will generate the terraform provider datasource and datasource_test files for the ymls provided for tenant resource in config.
   ```
   ./terrajinja --pname="YourProviderName" --generate="provider,provider_test"
   ```
   Above command will generate the terraform provider.go and provider_test.go file for the provider yaml provided in config.


### YAML Guide:
***To enable yaml validation json schemas and autosuggestions:***

For ***resource*** :
   yaml header
```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../json_schema/resource_validate.json  
```
   yaml path 
```
/config/resources/
```   
For ***datasource*** :
   yaml header
```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../json_schema/datasource_validate.json
```
   yaml path 
```
/config/datasources/
```
For ***provider*** :
   yaml header
```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../json_schema/provider_validate.json  
```
   yaml path 
```
/config/provider.yml
```
For ***client*** :
   yaml header
```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../json_schema/client_validate.json  
```
   yaml path 
```
/config/client/
```
**Resource  Datasource  Provider**<br/>
For generating the terraform resources,provider,datasource with their test files , the yaml files should be kept to the above given paths.Here's the description of every attribute of why it exists and how it will be used in the generated file.

It is compulsory to add `yaml-language-server`, which provides you the autosuggestion while writing the yaml. 

| Attribute | Description | 
| --- | ---------- |
| `provider_name` | *`string`*<br/>The name of the Terraform Provider you are working on. |
| `name` | *`string`*<br/>The name of the `resource` for which you are writting yaml. |
| `imports` | *`list of strings`* <br/> List of import links of modules to include in go file. |
| `unique_attribute` | *`list of strings`*<br/> unique_attribute is an array of strings that must be required and not dependent on parent and is of type string, it is preferred that you only write one parameter only, Moreover it is used for parallel testing. |
| `schemas` | *`list of objects`*<br/> schemas contains the list of objects, each object represents the schema element for resource. |
| `attribute` | *`string`*<br/> attribute is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes the name of the attribute. |
| `type` | *`string`*<br/> type is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes the type of the attribute. Values which can be provided to this field are `string, int, float, bool, map, list and set`. |
| `forcenew` | *`boolean(fixed:true)`*<br/> forcenew is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes whether we want to enable or disable forcenew for the attribute in schema. |
| `required` | *`boolean(fixed:true)`*<br/> required is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes whether we want to enable or disable required for the attribute in schema. |
| `computed` | *`boolean(fixed:true)`*<br/> computed is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes whether we want to enable or disable computed for the attribute in schema. |
| `optional` | *`boolean(fixed:true)`*<br/>optional is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes whether we want to enable or disable optional for the attribute in schema. |
| `sensitive` | *`boolean(fixed:true)`*<br/> sensitive is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes whether we want to enable or disable sensitive for the sensitive attribute in schema. |
| `default_func` | *`boolean(fixed:true)`*<br/> default_func is basically a field for schema.EnvDefaultFunc used for provider. |
| `envvar` | *`string`*<br/> envvar is basically a field for setting schema.EnvDefaultFunc environment variable used for provider. |
| `default` | *`(number,string)`*<br/> default is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which is used when we want to provide the default value to the attribute in schema. |
| `description` | *`string`*<br/> description is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which denotes the description of the attribute. |
| `max_items` | *`number`*<br/> max_items is used to defines a maximum amount of items that can exist within a TypeSet or TypeList. |
| `min_items` | *`number`*<br/> max_items is used to defines a maximum amount of items that can exist within a TypeSet or TypeList. |
| `validation` | *`object`*<br/> validation is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which actually is a object which contains func_name as a attribute, However it is used for the primitive datatypes of schema. |
| `func_name` | *`string`*<br/> Field of Validation object which is a validateDiagFunc function. If a validation function needs a params and ignore_case in case of StringInSlice validation |
| `ignore_case` | *`boolean`*<br/> Field of Validation object which is used for StringInSlice/StringNotInSlice which returns a SchemaValidateFunc which tests if the provided value is of type string and matches/not matches the value of an element in the valid slice will test with in lower case if ignoreCase is true. |
| `params` | *`list`*<br/> Field of Validation object which is used to list test parameters. |
| `element` | *`object`*<br/>  element is basically a feild for objects in `schemas or schema` which should be provided when the type is in `list,set,map`. It is a object which contains the type and schema attribute.Used for Resource only.|
| `type` | *`string`*<br/> Field of element object used to describe Schema type as Resource/Schema for Elem in Type(List/Set/Map). |
| `schema` | *`list of object(for type:resource)`*<br/> Field of element with type(resource) used to describe Internal Schema Resource for Type(List/Set/Map). |
| `schema` | *`object(for type:schema)`*<br/> Field of element with type(schema) used to describe Internal Schema Schema for Type(List/Set/Map).  |
| `depends_on` | *`object`*<br/> depends_on is basically a field for objects in `schemas or schema` which is used to describe dependent resource name with hierarchy of attributes. |
| `resource_name` | *`string`*<br/> Field of depends_on object which is used to describe dependent resource name. |
| `attribute_name` | *`list`*<br/> Field of depends_on object which is used to describe list of dependent resource name with hierarchy.Example application_profile have tenant_dn which is dependent on tenant so we here provide id in attribute_name list and tenant as resource name. |


*ðŸ‘€It is recommended to create yaml schemas proper as per the rules provided by the Terraform.*
For Example:  *One can't provide required and optional both simultaneously to the single attribute.*
Refer this links for more info:-
1. [Schema Behaviour](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/schemas/schema-behaviors)
2. [Schema Types](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/schemas/schema-types)

Use Autosuggestions for ease of use in writing YAML ðŸ˜Ž
One can find the example config at */config/resources/movie.yml*

**client**<br/>
For generating the terraform go client, the yaml files will go to the `/config/client` directory. An example `movies.yml` is already provided for the reference. Here's the description of every attribute of why it exists and how it will be used in the generated file.

| Attribute | Description | 
| --- | ---------- |
| `include` | *`list of strings`* <br/>Include contains all the third party packages that needs to be imported for the execution of the go file. Built in packages will be automatically imported. Listing the packages here does not essentially do anything helpful but you can simply hover over them in vs code and install them with one click. Kinda makes the work easier. |
| `endpoint` | *`list of objects`*<br/>Endpoints consists of the properties `path`, `name`, `GET / POST / PUT / DELETE` and `params`. At least one of the HTTP Method is required to be present. |
| `endpoint.path` | *`string`*<br/> path is a string that holds the path to where the specified HTTP request needs to be made. |
| `endpoint.name` | *`string`*<br/> name will be used in conjuction with the HTTP Method to generate the function name. |
| `endpoint.params` | *`list of strings`*<br/> params is an array of strings that contains the query params from the path. for example, if the path is */movies/id* and *id* is a query param, then you can specify it in the params and it will be handled accordingly. |
| `endpoint.overwriteBaseURL`| This is not ready to use yet, can be ignored. |
| `endpoint.METHOD`| *`object`* <br/> Every method will contain 2 properties. `funcName` and `args`. POST Method can contain one additional property `unique`. the value for unique attribute can be set the unique identifier variable name of the resource from the response. |
| `endpoint.METHOD.funcName`| *`string`*<br/>`funcName` is a string denoting the function name. In case you'd like to specify a name yourself, or in conflicting scenarios, such as when there exists multiple methods of the same type on endpoints who have same value for the `name` attribute.|
| `endpoint.METHOD.args`| *`string`*<br/>Args refers to the arguments the function created will have. it will have the following properties: `name`, `type`, `send`, `pointer`, and `value`. The first two are self-explanatory. `send` indicates if this argument is to be sent as payload when making the request, pointer indicates that this argument will be a pointer, and value can be statically defined if its a primitive variable otherwise will be a reference to one of the item from the `data` section. Value will be used for the testing purposes when calling the  function. Other methods can also contain `fromPostResponse`, that will us the id of the resource acquired from POST call as value.|
| `data`| *`list of objects`*<br/> This contains all the non-primitive values for variables such as structs. This section is very much similar to args hence not explained in depth.|

*ðŸ‘€It is recommended to create endpoints in the particular order of `POST -> GET -> PUT -> DELETE`. This way, you can use the `fromPostRequest` attribute in the subsequent endpoints to perform the GET, PUT and DELETE operations on the same resource created with the POST call.*

Use Autosuggestions for ease of use in writing YAML ðŸ˜Ž

This ensures that the resource will be deleted every time and ensures that the same test can be run successfully multiple times without worrying that resource with the same value would be already existing that rather expects some unique value.

The data and endpoints part of the yaml have some inconsistencies. Such as when defining the args and data attributes. Of course this can be made more uniform, but it was a lazy decision, and the efforts were better to be put at completing the features rather than refactoring for the aesthetics.

You can find the example config at /config/client/movies.yml

```
endpoints: 
  - path: "/movies"
    name: movie
    GET:
      funcName: GetAllMovies
   ...
```

## Contributor Guide

Jinja Templates are contained in the templates directory. Any change for the existing resources are to be made there. You can create a new template or modify the existing ones as per the requirements. Make sure that the new changes does not break the existing resources generated using the current state of the product. For major updates, if possible maintain another branch, repo or version. Merge only after thoroughly testing and making sure that the new updates does not introduct any breaking updates.

JSON Schema for validating the YAMLs will go in the json_schema folder. If you introduce any new attribute and change any exising ones, you can modify the schema there. Comments are provided whenever seemed necessary. The same is expected for future changes, to doucment the code using comments whenever necessary and to keep the readme updated.
